## Create a repository on the created github.com account and clone it locally. Set up accesses so that you can push changes to branches. Init commit can also be local, it's at your discretion. Then implement the following scenarios.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create 5-10 commits. (Example: create files, change their contents). Output their log screen, take a screenshot and add it to the report.

2. Use reflog to go to the previous commit (at your discretion). Output, screen, report. (Output their log screen, take a screen and add to report.)

4. Create a commit and add additional changes to it (add, for example, a dot, space, etc. to the file to be modified) using ammend. OSR.

5. Make the commit in main. But don't do a git push (this is important!), make the changes locally.

6. Make this commit end up in the new branch with git reset --hard. OSR

9. Start over (it's important that you do locally what I specified to do locally). Either approach can be used. OSR

Run the finalized report on your PRIVATE repository where you have already added me or will add me.
